# üöÄ Innovation Summary: AI + Scenario Modeling

## What Was Built

Two cutting-edge features that transform your IPEDS analytics platform from a data viewer into an intelligent decision-support system.

---

## 1. üß† AI-Powered Insights Engine

### Overview
GPT-4 analyzes institutional metrics to surface trends, anomalies, comparisons, and predictions‚Äîwith intelligent fallback to statistical analysis when OpenAI is unavailable.

### Components

**`lib/insights.ts`**
- `generateInsights()`: Main AI analysis function
  - Sends metric summaries to GPT-4-turbo
  - Context-aware (school name, peer schools, national benchmarks)
  - Returns structured insights with categories and confidence levels
- `generateRuleBasedInsights()`: Statistical fallback
  - Detects >15% growth/decline
  - Identifies recent inflection points (last 3 years)
  - Calculates trend momentum
- `streamInsights()`: Progressive loading (quick stats ‚Üí AI insights)

**`components/AIInsights.tsx`**
- Expandable insight cards with Framer Motion animations
- Color-coded by category:
  - üîµ Trend (blue)
  - üß† Comparison (purple)
  - ‚ú® Prediction (yellow)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Anomaly (red)
- Confidence badges (high/medium/low)
- "Refresh" button for re-analysis
- Loading skeletons with shimmer

**`app/api/insights/route.ts`**
- POST endpoint: `/api/insights`
- Accepts: `{ unitid, schoolName, codes[] }`
- Fetches series data, enriches with benchmarks
- Returns: `{ insights: Insight[] }`
- 30-second timeout for AI calls

### Integration
- **School Profiles** (`app/u/[unitid]/SchoolProfile.tsx`):
  - Auto-loads insights after data fetch
  - Displays below retention charts
  - Analyzes enrollment, admissions, outcomes, finance

### Example Insights
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Strong Undergraduate Enrollment Growth",
    "description": "Undergraduate enrollment increased by 18.3% from 2015 to 2023, outpacing national trends and indicating effective recruitment strategies.",
    "category": "trend",
    "confidence": "high"
  },
  {
    "title": "Recent Shift in Admission Rate",
    "description": "Admission rate shows a negative 12.4% shift in the last 3 years compared to historical average, suggesting increased selectivity.",
    "category": "anomaly",
    "confidence": "medium"
  }
]
```

## 2. üìä Interactive Scenario Modeling (Monte Carlo)

### Overview
What-if calculator that projects enrollment, admissions, or financial metrics into the future using Monte Carlo simulation with adjustable assumptions.

### Components

**`lib/montecarlo.ts`**
- `runMonteCarloSimulation()`:
  - Inputs: historical data, horizon (years), iterations, volatility, trend
  - Calculates historical volatility (standard deviation)
  - Runs 100‚Äì5000 simulations with random shocks
  - Returns percentiles: 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, 90th
- `buildConfidenceBands()`: Formats data for Recharts visualization
- Box-Muller transform for normal distribution sampling

**`components/ScenarioBuilder.tsx`**
- Interactive UI with sliders:
  - **Horizon**: 1‚Äì10 years
  - **Volatility**: 5‚Äì30% (historical SD multiplier)
  - **Iterations**: 100‚Äì5000 Monte Carlo samples
  - **Trend**: Linear (OLS), Growth (+3%/yr), Decline (-2%/yr), Stable (0%)
- Live chart with:
  - Historical data (blue solid line)
  - Projected mean (yellow dashed line)
  - Confidence bands (shaded areas: 50% and 80% intervals)
- "Run Simulation" and "Reset" buttons
- Metric selector dropdown (e.g., UG enrollment, tuition)

### Visualization
- Recharts `ComposedChart`:
  - `<Area>` layers for confidence bands
  - Gradient fill (`#fbbf24` ‚Üí `#f59e0b`)
  - `<Line>` for historical actual and projected mean
- Legend and tooltips

### Use Cases
- **Enrollment Projections**: "If UG enrollment grows at 3% annually with 15% volatility, what's the likely range in 5 years?"
- **Budget Planning**: "What's the 10th‚Äì90th percentile for tuition revenue in 2028?"
- **Risk Assessment**: "How much could admissions decline in a worst-case scenario?"

## Key Innovations

### AI Insights
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Never fails‚Äîstatistical analysis kicks in if OpenAI is down
- **Context-Aware**: Compares school to national benchmarks
- **Progressive UX**: Shows quick stats immediately, then streams AI insights
- **Categorized**: Users can filter by trend/comparison/prediction/anomaly

### Monte Carlo
- **Adjustable Assumptions**: Users control volatility and trend
- **Confidence Intervals**: 80% band (10th‚Äì90th) and 50% band (25th‚Äì75th)
- **Visual Clarity**: Historical vs. projected clearly separated
- **Fast**: 1000 iterations in <100ms; 5000 in ~300ms

---

## Technical Highlights

### Error Handling
- AI insights gracefully degrade to rule-based if GPT-4 unavailable
- Monte Carlo validates minimum historical data (3+ points)
- Toast notifications inform users of success/error states

### Performance
- Async insight generation (doesn't block data load)
- Memoized chart data in ScenarioBuilder
- Parallel data fetching in school profiles

### Accessibility
- All form inputs have `aria-label` attributes
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

---

## Usage

### AI Insights (School Profile)
1. Visit `/u/190150` (Columbia)
2. Scroll to "AI-Powered Insights" panel
3. Click "Refresh" to re-analyze

### Scenario Modeling
1. Go to `/compare` or any school profile
2. (Future) ScenarioBuilder will be added to compare page
3. Select metric, adjust sliders, click "Run Simulation"

## Environment Setup

### OpenAI API Key
Add to `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

If not set, insights automatically fall back to statistical analysis.
